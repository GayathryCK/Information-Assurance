The repository includes the entire codebase and architecture diagrams for research on deepfake detection through deep learning models. This study tests and evaluates four advanced architectures including InceptionResNetV2, VGG19, CNN, and Xception to determine their effectiveness in detecting manipulated media.  The models were trained and validated using Kaggle Deepfake Detection Challenge dataset.
